# Benchmark for Neural Arithmetics

The repository is a collection of real data from interesting engineering
applications. So far, it consists of regression problems, but more are
coming...


## Benchmark scripts

- data that should not be uploaded to the repo should be stored in
  `data/_DIRNAME` (`data/_*` is in `.gitignore`)
